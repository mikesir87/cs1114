# CS1114 Notes

All material contained within this repository is being made freely available to any interested parties.  It is authored by Michael Irwin for the use of teaching CS1114 at Virginia Tech.  The general outline and order of the curriculum was already determined before I started.  But, the content and presentation of it is mine.
