## Error Types

- **Syntax errors** - invalid characters, commands, or instructions
  - Spotted by the compiler
- **Logic errors** - problems that cause intended outcomes or behaviors
  - Often referred to as **bugs**
  - NOT caught by a compiler. Caught by testing or users

## Testing vs Debugging

</div>

- **Testing** - by writing tests, we search for the **presence** of errors
  - Should be done by developers
- **Debugging** - look for the **source** of an error
  - Often done by maintainers
  - Many times, the root cause is far from where you see the error


---

## Unit Testing

- Testing specific units of code (method, lines, classes)
- Should be done during development
- **Validates the contract** (sound familiar) - does it do what it should?
  - If we call `hop()`, does the Jeroo move one space?
  - If we call `turn(RIGHT)` when facing east, does the Jeroo end up facing south?
- Test the boundaries (zero, one, full)
  - If I call `add(jeroo, 15, 15)` when the world is only 12x12, what happens?
  - If I call `add(jeroo, 8, 8)`, but somethingâ€™s there, what happens?

---

## Testing Terminology

- **Test case** - an individual test for a specific behavior/unit
  - Written as a single method in a test class
- **Claim/assertion** - a statement expressing the expected behavior/outcome
  - Placed within test cases. A single test case can make several claims/assertions
- **Test fixture** - the collection of initial conditions used in one or more cases
  - Setup performed before tests are actually run


---

## Testing Recipe

1. Setup the test
   - Create initial conditions
2. Perform actions
   - Each test case should perform a separate action/condition
3. Make assertions
   - Validate that the actions had the expected outcomes


---

## Test assertions

- Assertions are used to validate behavior
- `assertEquals(expected, actual)` - validate `expected` and `actual` are equal
- `assertTrue(actual)` - validates that `actual` is true
- `assertFalse(actual)` - validates that `actual` is false

<br />
```java
public void testHop() {
    world.add(hurdler, 2, 5);

    hurdler.turnCorner();

    assertEquals(4, hurdler.getGridX());
    assertEquals(5, hurdler.getGridY())
    assertTrue(hurdler.isFacing(SOUTH));
    assertFalse(hurdler.hasFlower());
}
```

## Designing Tests

<div class="pull-right">
    <img src="images/scenario.jpg" style="width:400px;margin-left:50px;" />
</div>

- What do we need to test?
  - Hint - we can test each of the new methods we added to the Hurdler
- What are the various conditions we should test?
